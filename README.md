# C++ brushless motor calibration

This repo contains the code to calibrate, arm and use brushless motor.
The products used for developing this classes is reachable by the following link:

- [Calibration of esc - Amazon link](https://www.amazon.ae/Kyrio-Brushless-Propeller-Quadcopter-Helicopter/dp/B089NLC61X)
- [ESC docs](https://usermanual.wiki/Document/30ABLDCESCProductManual.1338503313/view)

To control Raspberry's GPIO I used [pigpio](https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/download.html) library. \
I hope my work can help you, enjoy your coding.
